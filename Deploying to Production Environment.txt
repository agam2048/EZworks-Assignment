Deploying a secure file-sharing system involves several steps to ensure a stable and secure production environment. Here's a high-level plan for deploying the described system:

1. Infrastructure Setup: 

* Choose a reliable cloud service provider (like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for hosting your application.
* Set up virtual machines or containers for the backend application.
* Implement necessary security measures like firewalls, access controls, and encryption protocols.


2. Database Setup: 

* Utilize a secure database to store the data, access permission etc. (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
* Implement proper encryption methods.


3) Backend Development: 

* Develop RESTful APIs according to the specified functionalities for both Ops User and Client User actions.
* Use authentication mechanisms for user login, signup, and authorization.
* Implement file upload validation for Ops User, allowing only pptx, docx, and xlsx files.
* Generate encrypted download URLs accessible only to Client Users for securely downloading files.


4) Testing:

* Perform comprehensive testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and security testing.
Ensure all functionalities work as expected and there are no vulnerabilities in the system.


5) Deployment:

* Use deployment tools like Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and easy management.
* Deploy the application to the production environment while following best practices for security and performance.


6)Continuous Updates and Maintenance:

* Regularly update the system with security patches and bug fixes.


7) Backup and Disaster Recovery:

* Implement backup strategies to prevent data loss and ensure disaster recovery procedures are in place.


8) Documentation:

* Document the deployment process, configurations, and any third-party integrations for future reference and troubleshooting.


To preserve the integrity of the system and safeguard user data, it is imperative to adhere to security best practises during the deployment process. These practises include encryption for sensitive data, secure communication protocols, access controls, and frequent security audits. Make sure that applicable data protection laws and regulations are followed as well.
